You may have learned about trigonometric functions such as **sine** and **cosine** as being defined by
the ratios of sides of a triangle (*SOHCAHTOA*),
or in terms of points and lines related to the unit circle. For me, it didn't totally click until I started to think visually about
inscribing a triangle inside of a circle.

For example, you can think about the sine function as
measuring [action onMouseOver:`stage = 'sin'`]the distance from the x-axis[/action] of a point
on the unit circle at a particular angle. The sign (+/-) of that value indicates if the point lies above
or below the axis. Similarly the cosine can be
thought of as measuring [action onMouseOver:`stage = 'cos'`]the distance from the y-axis[/action] of
that same point.

It is useful to note that the cosine of an angle is the same as the sine of the complement of the angle. In other words,
it is the same operation as sine, just with respect to the y-axis instead of the x-axis.

The word *sine* originally came from the latin *sinus*, meaning "bay" or "inlet". However, it had a
long path to get there. The [link text:"earliest known reference" href:"http://jeff560.tripod.com/s.html" /] to the sine function is from [link text:"Aryabhata the Elder" href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata" /],
who used both *ardha-jya* (half-chord) and *jya* (chord) to mean *sine* in
Aryabhatiya, a Sanskrit text finished in 499 CE.

Jya, meaning chord, became *jiba* in Arabic, and was abbreviated as just *jb*. When the term was translated to latin in the
twelfth century, *jb* was incorrectly read as *jaib* (meaning "bay" or "inlet"), and thus translated as *sinus*.

The sine function has a [action onMouseOver:`stage='chord'; theta = Math.PI / 4;`]direct connection to chords on a circle[/action]. Pick two points on the unit circle,
then the length of the line connecting the two points is exactly twice the value of the sine of half the
angle between them. That is, `chord_length(θ) / 2 = sin(θ / 2)`.

 **Tangent** comes from the latin *tangere*, the verb meaning "to touch". A line tangent to a circle intersects it at exactly one point.
From this, a [action onMouseOver:`stage = 'tan'`]geometric construction of the tangent function[/action] makes a lot of sense: take the line tangent from a point on the unit
circle and calculate the distance along that line from the point of intersection with the circle, to the point of
intersection with the x-axis. Similarly, the distance from that same point on the unit circle [action onMouseOver:`stage = 'cotan'`]to the y-axis[/action] is
the value of the **cotangent** function.

The origin of **secant** can be traced to latin as well. It comes from the latin word *secare*, meaning "to cut".
By definition a secant line on a circle is any line that intersects it in two places, you can think of this
line as cutting the circle in two pieces. The secant function is the distance [action onMouseOver:`stage = 'sec'`]from the origin
to the point where the tangent line intercepts the x-axis[/action]. Note that if this secant line is extended, it cuts the
unit circle neatly in half. Again, the **cosecant** can be thought of as being the same as [action onMouseOver:`stage = 'cosec'`]the same function
with respect to the y-axis[/action].
